# ACP Task Dispatch

Send a discrete, self-contained task to the OpenClaw-mcode-ACP server instead of running it inline in the current session. Useful when:

- The task is long-running and you do not want to block
- You want a persistent record (SQLite history) for later review
- A worker pool should pick it up off the queue
- You want to observe progress via SSE / WebSocket events

## Setup

Same as `acp-collab`. The SDK lives at `$ACP_HOME/openclaw-skill/acp_tools.py` — `$ACP_HOME` is the only path source. See the Plugin README for the **Supported platforms** and the **Server contract (minimum)** this Skill depends on.

## Dispatch a task

```python
import os
import sys
from pathlib import Path

# 1. Resolve the SDK directory from the user-configured ACP_HOME.
#    ACP_HOME is the ONLY path source. This Plugin never hardcodes it.
acr_root = os.environ.get('ACP_HOME')
if not acr_root:
    raise RuntimeError(
        'ACP_HOME env var is not set. Install OpenClaw-mcode-ACP and set '
        'ACP_HOME to its install path. PowerShell: $env:ACP_HOME = "<path>"; '
        'bash/zsh: export ACP_HOME=/path/to/openclaw-mcode-acp. '
        'See Plugin README.'
    )
sdk_path = Path(acr_root).expanduser().resolve() / 'openclaw-skill'
if not sdk_path.is_dir():
    raise RuntimeError(f'SDK directory not found at {sdk_path}. Check ACP_HOME.')

sys.path.insert(0, str(sdk_path))
from acp_tools import create_task, get_task, list_history

# 2. Pick a workspace that exists on this machine. Path.cwd() is portable
#    across Windows, macOS, and Linux without modification.
workspace = Path.cwd()
task = create_task(
    prompt="用一句话回答:1+1=?",
    workspace=str(workspace),
    timeout=300,
)
print(task["task_id"])
```

`create_task` returns `{task_id, status, ...}`. The server runs it on a worker pool (default 3 concurrent) and persists every transition to SQLite.

## Poll for completion

```python
import time
task_id = task["task_id"]
while True:
    state = get_task(task_id)
    if state["status"] in ("completed", "failed", "timeout", "cancelled"):
        break
    time.sleep(2)
print(state.get("answer", state.get("error")))
```

## Inspect history

```python
recent = list_history(limit=20)
for t in recent["tasks"]:
    print(t["task_id"], t["status"], t.get("duration_ms"))
```

## Constraints

- The `prompt` is the entire instruction given to a fresh `mcode` subprocess. It must be self-contained — the subprocess has no memory of your session.
- The `workspace` directory must exist on the server's filesystem; pass any cross-platform path (`Path.cwd()`, an absolute path, etc.). The server runs `mcode` with that as cwd.
- Default `timeout` is 60 seconds. Raise it for longer work, but consider `--permission full` first if the task needs to write files.
- For multi-step peer work, prefer the `acp-collab` Skill instead — this Skill is for one-shot fire-and-forget dispatch.

## Failure handling

If `create_task` returns a non-2xx response, the server is likely down or rejected the request. Verify the server is reachable and that your environment is configured correctly (see the `Authentication` and `Server contract (minimum)` sections in the Plugin README). Stop and surface the error to the user; do not retry in a tight loop.

## Authentication reminder

- The server's shared secret is read from the environment by the SDK at request time. This Skill never embeds, prints, logs, echoes, or persists it.
- This Skill never sends the secret to any endpoint other than the configured ACP server (default `http://127.0.0.1:9999`).
- Do not request the secret from the user, and do not include it in any Skill output, error message, or tool response.
